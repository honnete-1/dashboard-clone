NYC Urban Mobility is an enterprise-grade full-stack analytics dashboard built to process, clean, and visualize over **7.4 million yellow taxi rides** from New York City in January 2019. The application runs a full ETL pipeline on raw datasets, integrates geospatial metadata from TLC shapefiles, stores clean records in a normalized SQLite database, and serves real-time insights through a Python Flask REST API to a beautifully styled, fully interactive vanilla JavaScript dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Filters:** Dynamically query rides by Borough, Hour of Day, and TLC Rate Code with no page reloads.
- **Dual Visual Themes:** Fully reactive Light/Dark mode switcher. All ApexCharts update their color scheme on-the-fly without refreshing.
- **KPI Metrics Panel:** Instant counters showing Total Trips, Average Fares, Tipping Percentage, and Average Speed.
- **ApexCharts Visualizations:**
  - *Hourly Congestion Chart:* Line/Column combo chart showing the inverse relationship between trip volume and vehicle speed throughout the day.
  - *Top 10 Busiest Pickup Zones Chart:* Horizontal bar chart rendering the top neighborhoods, ranked using a custom Min-Heap algorithm (not a library sort).
  - *Tipping Behavior Chart:* Column chart comparing average tip percentages across credit card and cash payment methods.
- **Precomputed Cache:** The default dashboard view loads from a precomputed JSON file for instantaneous page load, bypassing live database queries on first render.
- **Spatial Metadata:** The `zones` table holds geospatial properties (`Shape_Area`, `Shape_Length`) programmatically merged from official TLC shapefiles using GeoPandas.

## ⚙️ Local Setup & Installation

> **Good news:** This project is fully runnable out-of-the-box using the pre-seeded **50k-row deployment database** (`nyc_mobility_deploy.db`) that is already committed in the `data/` folder. You do **not** need to download the 680MB raw dataset to run and test the full dashboard!

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+** — [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** — [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Check your Python version:
```bash
python --version
```

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/honnete-1/NYC-Mobility-Dashboard.git
cd NYC-Mobility-Dashboard
```

---

## 🌐 Environment Setup

### 3. (Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment
This keeps the project dependencies isolated from your system Python:

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install All Dependencies

```bash
pip install Flask flask-cors pandas geopandas pyarrow numpy fpdf2
```

Or install the core deployment dependencies only:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🖥️ Running the Backend

The Flask backend serves both the API and the frontend static files. Running it is a single command:

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

**What happens when you run this:**
1. The server checks whether a database exists in `data/`.
2. If it finds `nyc_mobility_deploy.db` (the pre-seeded deployment database), it boots immediately.
3. If **neither** database is found, it automatically runs the full ETL pipeline to build the database from the raw CSV file (requires the 680MB raw dataset to be in `data/`).
4. Flask starts serving on port `5000`.

Expected output:
```
Starting flask server on port 5000...
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

---

## 🌍 Running the Frontend

Because the Flask backend is configured to serve the frontend static files directly, there is **no separate frontend server** needed.

Once the backend is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

The full dashboard will load automatically. The frontend JavaScript (`app.js`) connects to the Flask API at the same origin, so no environment variable configuration is needed.

## 🗄️ Database Design & ERD

The database is structured as a **Star Schema** — a widely used data warehousing design that minimizes data redundancy and maximizes query efficiency.

- **Central Fact Table (`trips`):** Contains all 22 transactional and computed columns per ride.
- **Dimension Tables (`vendors`, `rate_codes`, `payment_types`, `zones`):** Contain descriptive lookup data. The `zones` table also holds spatial attributes (`shape_area`, `shape_length`) merged from TLC shapefiles using GeoPandas.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![Database Entity-Relationship Diagram](erd_diagram.png)

> *The ERD above shows the Star Schema with the central `trips` fact table linked to four dimension lookup tables via foreign keys.*

### Query Optimizations

| Optimization | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **B-Tree Index on `tpep_pickup_datetime`** | Enables fast hour-of-day filtering |
| **B-Tree Index on `PULocationID`** | Enables fast borough and pickup zone filtering |
| **B-Tree Index on `DOLocationID`** | Enables fast dropoff zone filtering |
| **`PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`** | Write-Ahead Logging for faster concurrent reads |
| **`PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY`** | Stores temporary results in RAM instead of disk |

---

## 🧹 Data Integrity & Cleaning Log

We removed **198,392 rows** (2.59% of the dataset) due to data quality issues. The full cleaning log is stored in `data/data_cleaning_log.json`.

| Anomaly Class | Rows Removed | Validation Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wrong Year/Month** | 537 | Pickup datetime must be within January 2019 |
| **Pickup After Dropoff** | 4 | Dropoff time must be after pickup time |
| **Negative Duration** | 6,294 | Trip duration must be > 0 minutes |
| **Extreme Duration** | 20,913 | Trip duration must be ≤ 180 minutes (3 hours) |
| **Invalid Distance** | 54,802 | Trip distance must be > 0 and ≤ 100 miles |
| **Invalid Fare** | 9,591 | Fare amount must be > $0 and ≤ $500 |
| **Invalid Total** | 8,568 | Total charge must be > $0 and ≤ $1,000 |
| **Invalid Passengers** | 117,438 | Passenger count must be between 1 and 6 |
| **Duplicate Rows** | 34 | Exact duplicates on key columns removed |

---

## 🧮 Custom DSA Algorithm: Min-Heap

To rank the **Top 10 Busiest Pickup Neighborhoods**, the backend uses a fully custom **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** implemented from scratch in `backend/algorithms.py`. This was a core project requirement — no standard sorting library functions were used.

### How It Works

```
Stream all 263 NYC zone trip counts
         ↓
For each zone count:
   ├── If heap size < K (10)   → Push onto heap
   └── If zone count > heap root → Replace root, sift down
         ↓
Extract the top 10 elements sorted in descending order
```

### Complexity Analysis

| Metric | This Algorithm | Standard `sort()` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time** | $O(N \log K)$ | $O(N \log N)$ |
| **Space** | $O(K)$ — constant | $O(N)$ |
| **Where** | N = 263 zones, K = 10 | N = 263 zones |

## 👥 Group Participation & Reflection

### Team Members & Roles

| Team Member | Role & Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Student A (Honnete)** | Backend development (`app.py`), database schema design (`db_schema.py`), ETL data pipeline, custom Min-Heap algorithm (`algorithms.py`), Vercel deployment |
| **Student B (Emmanuella)** | Frontend interface (`index.html`, `styles.css`), ApexCharts integration, API integration (`app.js`), Light/Dark theme system |

### What We Learned

- **Data Scale Challenges:** Processing 7.4M rows on a laptop required chunk-based reading. We learned how to use `chunksize` in Pandas to keep memory stable.
- **Relational Design Pays Off:** Designing the Star Schema upfront made query writing straightforward. Without it, our SQL would have been slow and messy.
- **Cloud vs. Local Differences:** Deploying on Vercel taught us that Linux servers are case-sensitive (unlike Windows). A folder named `Frontend` vs `frontend` caused 404 errors in production.
- **Caching is Powerful:** Pre-computing the default dashboard view into a JSON file made page loads feel instant—a small engineering decision with a huge user experience payoff.
